# piCAMTracker
This is another Raspberry Pi motion tracker based on Python, picamera and opencv.   
It makes heavily use of the motion blocks generated by GPU of the Raspberry Pi.   
**Target** A crossing event is detected on a GPIO port and a picture of the event is transmitted via nginx to a smart phone for example.

# Prerequisites
* picamera (1.13)
* opencv (3.4.1)
* pygame (1.9.3)
* libh264decoder   (currently included)  
 
# Status
Currently this is an alpha release.   
* The object detection is working quiet well in different light conditions. It still needs some improvements.
* The first outdoor tests went very good. The fisheye setup iwith the V1 camera seems to be the best setup for our purposes. (F3F model air racing)
 * V1 camera from Waveshare (module G); 1280x720 pixels; 49 frames / s; full FOV; 160MB GPU memory
 * V2 camera with standard lens; 1280x720 pixels; 61 frames / s (68 should be possible); partial FOV; 160MB GPU memory.
 * In general the V2 camera needs more light than the V1
* The web interface supports the most rudimentary stuff to control the camera.
* no picture/video saving so far.   
* we have a printed cover available. (see wiki section)

# TODO
* More testing in real conditions is needed.
* create a full automatic setup with embedded Wifi access point. (just power on the device)
* Save the stream and develope a debugging facility to improve the detection.
* Make libh264decoder Python 3 able and update the source repository
* if possible avoid to decode h264  (I saw others using a splitter on the preview port)
