# piCAMTracker
This is another Raspberry Pi motion tracker based on Python, picamera and opencv.   
It makes heavily use of the motion blocks generated by GPU of the Raspberry Pi.   
**Target** A crossing event is detected on a GPIO port and a picture of the event is transmitted via nginx to a smart phone for example.

# Prerequisites
* picamera
* opencv
* pygame
* libh264decoder   (currently included)  
 
# Status
Currently this is an alpha release.   
* The object detection is working quiet well in different light conditions. It still needs some improvements.
* The web interface supports the most rudimentary stuff to control the camera.
* no picture/video saving so far.   

# Pictures
The hardware is quite simple. A next version should use a closed box and a wireless connection to send crossing events.

The web interface can be used to control the device

# TODO
* Next phase is a testing phase. (Until now the system has been tested in the office only)
* create a full automatic setup with embedded Wifi access point. (just power on the device)
* Save the stream and develope a debugging facility to improve the detection.
* Add a pull request to libh264decoder (I am using a patched version)
* if possible to encode/decode h264 at the same time then get rid of libh264decoder
* make use of the wiki.
